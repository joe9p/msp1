# Milestone Project 1 - Lanvin Studios

The purpose of my website is to be used by the public to enquire and book out studios for a London-based recording studio company called Lanivn Studios. 

## Description and Goals

The website shows what Lanvin Studios offers which is high-end recording studios; the website is mainly targetted at producers, songwriters, vocalists and artists who want to book them. 

Website goals are:
- To show what Lanvin Studios does/ offers.
- To provide information about the studios. 
- To be interactive to allow the customer to guide their way through the website to obtain all the info they need.
- To be able to book the studios easily.
- Visually interesting, professional and modern.

## Design Choices

The design choices I chose for this website were very specific. I wanted to create a website that was professional, clean and elegant but also one that was able to achieve the goal I set out as the purpose of the site; which it does. 

The fonts **Inter** and **Bebas** are modern and clean to fit the aesthetic I wanted to provide along with the natural, muted colours that matched the images and clean, professional photographs all leading to a great looking website.

The styling was also specific as I wanted to have a lot of space between images, text, backgrounds, menu items etc to all accomodate to the clean look.

My design choices were integral throughout my testing process also as I aimed my HTML and CSS to match with my design choices so everything suited and produced an informal and sleek site. 

## Wireframes

## Code
- All the code used in the project is my own but I did need help occsionally when coding.
- I used Stack Overflow and W3 Schools when I was stuck with a piece of code or needed help with ideas on how to structure my CSS. For example in the 'intropara' 'circle-container' 'welcome' and 'studiogallertext' CSS tags. 
- I was inspired by the central image on the 'Love Running' homepage and decided to centralise the circle image in my website as I thought it would make a great addition to my website but altered it using my own knowledge of CSS rules and HTML code to fit into my design nicely. 
- A lot of my code was a very trail and error process in terms of making sure everything was fitting correctly and inputted correctly. I used the Google Chrome 'Inspect' tool when my code didn't look right or wasn't working how it should in order to test and fix my code. This occured when I was coding homepahe and espcially the 'Book Now' page and the gallery of studio pictures I used; to make sure everything was working correctly. 

## Deployment
